
Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000

2. Find the total number of distinct records for the primary keys in each of the tables listed below:

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = no primary key
iii. Category = no primary key
iv. Attribute = no primary key
v. Review = 10,000
vi. Checkin = no primary key
vii. Photo = 10,000
viii. Tip = no primary key
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = no primary key
xi. Elite_years = no primary key

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:Select COUNT(*)

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

Users with higher yelping duration show a stronger positive corelation between review_count and fans 
than the users with lower yelping duration. Yes, more reviews correlate with more fans for higher yelping time.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
           Users with high fans have also been listed as 'useful' and 'funny'. And the number of times they are listed as useful or funny 
           depends on the review count. Eg. Herald and Gerald.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? Yes, Restaurants with 2-3 stars are mostly day time while 
most restaurants with 4-5 stars are active in the evening.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? Yes, approximately
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, The postal group for both the groups is different.

SQL code used for analysis:

Select B.city

       ,H.hours

       ,C.category
       
,case 
     
            When B.stars between 2 And 3 Then '2-3'
     
            When B.stars between 4 And 5 Then '4-5'
       
end As star_rating
      
,sum(B.review_count)
      
,postal_code

From business B 

     Inner join hours H 
     On 
     B.id = H.business_id

     Inner Join Category C 
     ON 
     C.business_id = B.id

Where B.city= 'Toronto' And C.category='Restaurants'

Group by star_rating;

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The number of reviews for open businesses is higher than number of reviews for closed businesses
         
         
ii. Difference 2: Checkin count of open businesses is higher than closed businesses

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp 
dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses
to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number
of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come 
up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   Sentiment analysis in the text of review to find out the best restaurants. What are the top 5 restaurants?
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

   I will need the review data for accessing the sentiment in the text of the review and select the category 
   of the type of business from the category table.Since these two don't have any key in common I will need to join
   the business table with the review table with a subquery of the category table.
               
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

|   4.0 | Big Wong Restaurant                    | My brother was in town and wanted to get a quick lunch before I had to go into work.

|       |                                        | Beef Ramen - for 5 you can get a bowl of ramen (same noodles as used at Monta) and it comes with big chunks of beef. They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned. |

|   4.0 | Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse | My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night. When considering our options, we were sold when we saw the bacon board on the menu. It did not disappoint! It was an excellent and delicious start to our nice (giant) dinner.                                                                                                                                                        |

|       |                                        | For our main course we had the BBQ sampler for two, as well as the shrimp and grits appetizer because I just couldn't help myself! The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.                                         |

|       |                                        | The sampler was very good, but not amazing. I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile. |

|       |                                        | Since we brought up the missing turkey,  we were given a cobbler desert for free. That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top. Whatever... they don't claim to be dessert experts, so what did I expect? I just know better for next time. ;)                                                              |

|       |                                        | Atmosphere is great - cozy, clean and modern. Just hipster enough to feel cool, but not so much to make you feel uncomfortable if you didn't show up with facial hair or a vintage t-shirt. Service is not as attentive as I would prefer, but most likely due to having too much to do, as opposed to a lack of effort. Everyone was very nice.                                                       |
